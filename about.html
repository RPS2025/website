            <h1>Our Story & Leadership</h1>
            <p>The Retired Professors Society Pokhara brings together distinguished academics to continue their intellectual contributions and foster community engagement</p>
        </div>

        <section class="narrative-section">
            <h2>Our History and Mission</h2>
            
            <p>The Retired Professors Society Pokhara was formally established in February 2023 (Fagun 2079 BS) as a common platform for retired academics residing in and around Pokhara. The society builds upon years of discussion among retired faculty members from various institutions who recognized the need for an organized body to harness their collective wisdom and experience.</p>
            
            <p>The concept had been proposed much earlier by pioneering educators like Mr. George John, the founding principal of Prithvi Narayan Campus, who first suggested the idea to former Campus Chief Mr. Ganesh Bahadur Gurung. Other advocates included Mr. Balgopal Amatya from the English department and Associate Professor Dhruba K.C., all of whom saw the potential for retired professors to remain engaged in intellectual and social contributions.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Our Founding Moment</h3>
                <p>The society took concrete shape during a picnic organized by Prithvi Narayan Campus professors on February 4, 2023, where senior professors including Raghunath Adhikari, Prof. Dr. Dil Bahadur Kshetri, and Gehendra Shwar Koirala emphasized immediate action. This led to the first formal meeting on February 20, 2023 at Lake City College, where an ad hoc committee was formed with Mr. Krishna Prasad Poudel as coordinator.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>From these modest beginnings, the society has grown to include over 110 members from diverse academic backgrounds including Tribhuvan University, Pokhara University, Nepal Sanskrit University, and various specialized campuses. Our membership represents a wealth of knowledge across disciplines from political science to engineering, forestry to nursing.</p>
            
            <p>The society's activities have included knowledge-sharing workshops, community outreach programs, and intergenerational dialogues. We've also worked to establish our organizational structure and draft our constitution with the assistance of legal expert Mr. Krishna Bahadur Gurung.</p>
            
            
            <h3>Our Vision for the Future</h3>
            <p>As we look ahead, we aim to strengthen our institutional framework while maintaining our focus on substantive activities. With ongoing retirements from academic institutions across the region, we anticipate continued growth in both membership and impact.</p>
            
            <p>Our objectives remain clear: to enhance the welfare of our members, contribute to public discourse, promote democratic values through academic expertise, and serve as an independent intellectual forum. We believe that retirement marks not an end to contribution, but a new chapter of service with the wisdom of experience.</p>
